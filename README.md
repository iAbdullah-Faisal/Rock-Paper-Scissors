# 🎮 Rock Paper Scissors

Hello again! This is **Abdullah**.  
This project is part of **The Odin Project – Foundations Course**, and it’s my implementation of the classic **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game using **JavaScript**.

---

## 🧠 Overview

A simple interactive game where the player competes against the computer for **5 rounds**.  
Each round compares both choices and awards a point to the winner.  
At the end, the final score is displayed, and the overall winner is announced.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Randomized computer choices using `Math.random()`
- User input via `prompt()` with validation
- Tracks and displays scores after every round
- Announces the final winner at the end of 5 rounds
- All logic handled in pure **JavaScript**

## 🧩 How It Works

Here’s a quick description of each main function:

- **`getComputerChoice()`** → Generates a random choice between _rock_, _paper_, and _scissors_.
- **`getHumanChoice()`** → Prompts the user for input, validates it, and returns the result.
- **`playRound(humanChoice, computerChoice)`** → Compares both choices, updates scores, and shows the result for that round.
- **`playGame()`** → Runs five rounds, keeps track of scores, and announces the final winner.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**

## 🧾 Development Log

### 🗓️ 2025-11-10

Started late because I wanted to get more comfortable with JavaScript basics.  
After reading and experimenting, I finally started the project around **10:52 PM**.

### 🗓️ 2025-11-11

- **11:33 AM** → Finished computer choice logic and tested it.
- **11:46 AM** → Finished human input logic and tested it.
- **12:04 PM** → Completed round logic and tested functionality.
- **12:30 PM** → Full game tested and working!

💤 _Side note:_ Slept early last night because of my 9 AM class 😅

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Add a **graphical UI** (buttons instead of `prompt()` and `alert()`)
- Display scores dynamically on the webpage
- Add **styling and animations** for a better experience
- Include a **“Play Again”** feature

## 💬 Personal Note

This project boosted my understanding of **functions**, **conditionals**, and **loops** in JavaScript.  
It feels amazing to build something that actually interacts with the user!

## 💡 Message to Others

If you’re just starting with JavaScript, **don’t rush.**  
Learn slowly, experiment often, and keep building small projects.  
Remember: practice, break things, fix them, and grow!
